ANN: deepseq-bounded 0.5 -> 0.6

Body:

This may affect depending code. Please consult the distro changelog
for specific information about how your code might be affected, or
better yet, refer to

  http://www.fremissant.net/deepseq-bounded/transition-5-6-7.html

and

  http://www.fremissant.net/deepseq-bounded/grammar.html

This is a transitional version of deepseq-bounded, with stability
of the grammar expected in early March for version 0.7.

This also causes major version bumps to the seqaid and leaky packages.
To update everything, issue

  cabal update
  cabal install --reinstall --force-reinstalls seqaid

which reinstalls the latest deepseq-bounded in passing. And also
if you were to run "seqaid demo" it will use the updated version
of leaky, so everything's up to date.

The homepage for these projects starts at

Kind Regards,
Andrew
